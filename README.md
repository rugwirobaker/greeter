# Learning gRPC

greeter is nothing more than a gRPC getting started exercise

## Dependecies
* `google.golang.org/grpc`
* `github.com/golang/protobuf/proto`

## Steps
To run this silly greeter app:

* make sure you have go installed.
* install the protobuf compiler
* install the grpc and protobuf dependencies.
* install the greeter command `$ make install`
* run the greeter server `$ make runserver`

## Example
`$ greeter name John Lenon`
